### December 5 2021
Market has been choppy the past few weeks with contributing factors including:
- Inflation news
- Covid-19 Omicron variant discovery and fear
- Decreased spending on Black Friday and Cyber Monday
- Earnings season
All of this has led to fewer breakout opportunities with some securities actually breaking down off of regular bullish patterns. $PUBM was a prime example. 

These are the stocks I'll be watching this week, though I'm unsure what sort of action if any I'll be taking given the market volatility. 

#### KROS
- Broke out violently after earnings and has progressed into a descending channel. 
- Touched the lower bollinger band and bounced off it and has proceeded to consolidate into a relatively distinguishable triangle.

#### LWLG
- Pulled back after a move up in October and November and is forming an okay looking triangle. 
- Right on its 20dSMA, looking to see if it bounces off and moves up.

#### INNV
- Broke out on November 9 and has since began consolidating. 
- Pulled back and successfully retested its breakout point, indicating a new support level.
- 5dSMA and 20dSMA are really close to one another. Will be watching to see if the 5 day falls below the 20 day.

#### MGI
- Broke out recently on decent volume off its 20dSMA. 
- Since breakouts tend to last 3-5 days, there still may be time to get in if the entry is good.
- Touched its 50dSMA so it'll be interesting to see if the 50 day continues to act as a resistance level.

#### GWH
- Recently IPO'd spac that has since pulled back and consolidated a bit. 
- _Could_ be forming a short term cup and handle but not sure.
- 5dSMA just crossed over the 20dSMA which could be a bullish sign. 
- 50dSMA is catching up
