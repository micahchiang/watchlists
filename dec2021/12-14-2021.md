### Watchlist 12/14/2021

#### CLFD
- Consolidating after a move up in November
- 5 day and 20 day SMAs are right next to each other, look for the 5 day to stay above the 20 day
- MACD looks like it could cross back over the signal line

</details>

#### ACET
- Big move up last week, consolidating into a nice looking flag
- macd still looks pretty good
- On the upper bollinger band and way out in front of the 20dSMA, so may be overbought
